# Student Fee Management System

This README provides a comprehensive guide to the Student Fee Management System, a Flask-based web application for managing student registration, fee types, and payment tracking.

## System Overview

The Student Fee Management System is designed to help educational institutions manage student registrations and track fee payments. The system provides the following core functionalities:

- User authentication and management
- Student registration and management
- Fee type configuration
- Payment processing and tracking
- Reporting and dashboard views

## Code Explanation

### Database Models (`models.py`)

The system uses SQLAlchemy ORM with the following models:

1. **User Model**
   - Manages system users (admins, staff)
   - Includes authentication information
   - Implements UserMixin for Flask-Login integration

2. **Student Model**
   - Stores student information
   - Includes personal details and registration data
   - Links to payments through relationship

3. **FeeType Model**
   - Defines different fee categories
   - Stores amount, description, and payment frequency
   - Links to payments through relationship

4. **Payment Model**
   - Records all payment transactions
   - Stores payment details like amount, method, date
   - Links to both students and fee types through foreign keys

### Main Application (`app.py`)

The main application file sets up the Flask application, configures extensions, and defines the routes:

1. **Configuration**
   - Sets up SQLite database connection
   - Configures Flask-Login for authentication
   - Initializes the database

2. **Authentication Routes**
   - Login/logout functionality
   - Password hashing for security
   - Session management

3. **Student Management Routes**
   - Student registration
   - Student listing and details
   - Student profile management

4. **Fee Management Routes**
   - Creating and managing fee types
   - Fee scheduling and configuration

5. **Payment Processing Routes**
   - Recording new payments
   - Payment history and status
   - Receipt generation

6. **Dashboard and Reports**
   - Summary statistics
   - Payment status overview
   - Due payment alerts

### Form Classes (`forms.py`)

Uses Flask-WTF for form validation:

1. **LoginForm** - User authentication
2. **UserForm** - User registration and profile management
3. **StudentForm** - Student registration and profile updates
4. **FeeTypeForm** - Creating and editing fee types
5. **PaymentForm** - Recording payments with validation

### Templates

HTML templates using Jinja2 for dynamic content:

1. **base.html** - Base template with common layout elements
2. **login.html** - Authentication interface
3. **dashboard.html** - Main user interface after login
4. **student_register.html** - Form for adding new students
5. **students_list.html** - Display and search registered students
6. **fee_types.html** - Manage fee categories
7. **add_fee_type.html** - Form for creating new fee types
8. **make_payment.html** - Interface for recording payments
9. **payments_list.html** - View payment history
10. **payment_status.html** - Check payment status for students

## Setup and Installation

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install flask flask-sqlalchemy flask-login flask-wtf email_validator
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. Access the application at http://127.0.0.1:5000/

## Default Admin Account

- Username: admin
- Password: admin123

## System Workflow

1. **Authentication**: Users log in to access the system
2. **Setup**: Add fee types through the "Fee Types" section
3. **Registration**: Register students via "Register Student"
4. **Payments**: Record payments through "Make Payment"
5. **Monitoring**: View payment status and history for students
6. **Reporting**: Generate reports on fee collection and dues

## Security Features

- Password hashing for secure authentication
- Role-based access control
- Form validation to prevent invalid data
- Session management for secure user sessions

## Extension Possibilities

The system can be extended with:
- PDF receipt generation
- Email notifications for due payments
- Student/parent portal access
- Data export to Excel/CSV
- Advanced reporting features
- Fee discounts and scholarships management
